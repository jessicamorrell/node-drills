# node drills

in each directory, you'll find a javascript file with instructions in comments.

there will be things in here with which you're not familiar.

the first few are in bare node (no express/koa/hapi/whatever)

there are a handful of express drills

and then there are a few mongo/mongoose problems

i strongly suggest keeping [this](https://nodejs.org/api/) open for the first few

have fun!
