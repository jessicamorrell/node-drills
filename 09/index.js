// console.log('ALL THE THINGS')
// that gets annoying sometimes, doesn't it?
// you can be halfway through a project and suddenly realise
// your console is just _full_ of stuff.
// you know what might be useful? a little utility to log things to the console
// just based on a boolean (if `debug` is `true`, for example)
// this could actually be used in both node and the browser, maybe.
// give it a shot!
