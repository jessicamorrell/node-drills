// write another express server!
// have this one send something to the front-end (a string, maybe 'hello es6!')
// oh, and try to use an es6 feature or two.
// node can use most es6 things out of the box, as long as you have `'use strict'`
// at the top of the script
// the package.json has _not_ been provided this time around.
// `const` is like `var`. check out ttps://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-const
// to understand the difference between `const` and a constant in other languages.
// `let` is like `var`, but block-scoped instead of function-scoped.
// bonus: let the user (you) set the port this server will be using
