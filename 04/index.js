// you've all seen a REPL, now. pretty cool stuff, right?
// it's really useful. why bother running chrome, opening up a new tab,
// opening devtools, and opening the console, when you can just run
// js in your terminal?
// let's write a REPL using nothing but node built-ins.
// you'll want to require `repl`, here.
// don't forget to `chmod +x index.js` and throw in the shebang
// if you want to execute this.
// bonus: check the API docs for `net`, and figure out how you could
// connect to this REPL remotely.
